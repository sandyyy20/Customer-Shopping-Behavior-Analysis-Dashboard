# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## 📝 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **customer shopping behavior** to understand purchase trends and patterns.  
It involves **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Python, executing **SQL queries** in MySQL Workbench, and building an **interactive dashboard in Power BI**.  
The final insights are presented through a Power BI dashboard, PowerPoint presentation, and PDF report.

## 🪜 Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded the dataset into **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** using Pandas.
- Checked for null values, data types, and duplicates.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
- Converted data types and standardized column names.
- Ensured the dataset was ready for SQL queries and visualization.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed customer demographics, purchase frequency, and spending behavior.
- Visualized trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Found relationships between age, gender, and spending.

### 4. SQL Queries
- Imported cleaned data into **MySQL Workbench**.
- Executed queries such as:
  - Total sales by product category  
  - Average spending by gender  
  - Top customers by purchase amount  
  - Monthly sales performance  

### 5. Dashboard Creation
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** showing:
  - Sales trends over time  
  - Top product categories  
  - Customer segmentation  
  - Gender and age group analysis  

### 6. Reporting
- Created a **PowerPoint presentation** summarizing insights.
- Exported a **PDF report** for final submission.
